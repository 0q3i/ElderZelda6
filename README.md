# Elder Zelda 6

Elder Zelda 6:

Elder Zelda 6 is a small game inspired by the Elder Scrolls series and The Legend of Zelda. You find yourself in a lost forest where you encounter a girl who is also lost. Your mission is to help her navigate through the labyrinthine forest, facing monsters and overcoming obstacles along the way.

This game is a simple project created using the Pyxel game engine. The game is very primitive and does not even include music.

The game is currently in active development and could be considered to be in beta.
